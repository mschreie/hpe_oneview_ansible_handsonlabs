# Create an overall Workflow

We woudl like to ask you to create a Workflow template, which includes all Job Templates needed for the overall automation process. 

When done run this workflow and review job execution.
Also assure that the deployed server is installed as expected.

Hint:<br>
To be autonomous it might make sense to create a workflow which omits the reachout to the physical server. This might improve the chance to test your workflow. If that works well and time allows create a full featured workflow.
