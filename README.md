# Welcome to Red Hat / HPE Hands On Labs

## Introduction

This Lab will help understand how to use Ansible to automate HPE tools like HPE OneView and HPE iLO. If youâ€™re new to Ansible Automation, we suggest that you attend one of the Ansible Automation workshops to get started with the concepts. If you are planning to use Ansible Automation in production, we highly recommend attending the Red Hat official training to master the concepts as well as the product.
